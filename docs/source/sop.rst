**STANDARD OPERATION PROCEDURE**

Measure the ionic resistance of your electrode with the FIPT kit
==================================

.. include:: <isonum.txt>
.. See https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/rst/definitions.html

.. warning:: The orientation marking on the FIPT cell have to be placed on the top left side

1.	**Clean the workstation**
-------------------
Checklist : Gloves, googles, ethanol, wipe, FIPT cell ( composed by the support, the base, the top and the clamp), brush, tweezer, cutting tool, pipette, pipette tips and your electrode.

- Wear gloves and goggles
-	Clean the workstation with ethanol
-	Clean the pipette, the tweezer with dry wipe 
-	Set the pipette to 300ul and place the pipette tip
-	Clean all parts of the FIPT cell with the brush to remove any contamination of past measurement 
-	Clean the cutting tool with the brush, be careful of the blades.

2.	**Prepare the workstation**
-------------
Checklist : Ethanol, wipe, FIPT cell and your electrode.

- Clean the label on the cell wih ethanol
- Write the new label of the electrode and precise the side that you want to measure.

- Check age of electrolyte
- Check drill clutch setting produces 0.4Nm


3.	**Cut the electrode** 
-------------------
Checklist : Cutting tool, tweezer and your electrode labeled.

- Place the electrode on the cutting tool
- Press the blades down to cut out the electrode strip
- Collect the electrode strip with the tweezer
- Check the edges of the strip are clean after cutting

**Pay attention to face the side that you will measure up**

- Repeat the cutting for two strips total

4.	**Assemble the FIPT cell**
---------------
Checklist : FIPT cell ( composed by the support, the base, the top and the clamp), tweezer, pipette, separator, electrolyte and 2 strips of electrode.

- Place the first strip orthogonal to the foam of the FIPT cell. Face up the side that you measure. 

**Be careful on the orientation of the FIPT cell.**

-  Place one separator on the middle of the electrode strip in the FIPT cell gap.

**Be careful, put only one separator and to place it correctly in the relevant region.**

- Apply 300ul of electrolyte on the separator

-	Place the second strip on the top of the separator, orthogonal to the first strip. 
Face down the side that you measure.

- Check that the orientation markers are aligned
- Hook in plastic bar.
-	Screw in the middle screw until the clutch of the drill triggers (Torque 0.4Nm).

5.	**Run the measurement** 
---------------------------

Checklist : FIPT cell ( composed by the support, the base, the top and the clamp), tweezer, pipette, separator, electrolyte and 2 strips of electrode.

- Attach 2 measurement wires to the strips of the electrode to connect the FIPT cell to an impedance analyzer

- Carry out the FIPT measurement and determine the ionic resistance of your electrode
- Note that a good graph looks like a hockey stick .

6.	**Analyze your data**
--------------------------

To see how to analyze your FIPT data using our `fipt-analysis <https://github.com/deniz195/fipt-analysis>`_ , watch our follow up video
